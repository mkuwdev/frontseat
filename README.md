## FRONTSEAT

Frontseat is a membership platform, a web3 version of Patreon. We make it simple for creators to generate their own membership token in the form of NFT, which they can then utilize as a gate to their exclusive community.

To establish a creator profile, a creator must first launch their membership token in the form of NFT on our platform. Creators can then create content to be posted to their profiles. These contents will be encrypted by our platform. The creator's exclusive community and locked content are only accessible to those who own the creator's membership token.

The token is digitally scarce, allowing fans to re-sell the token on secondary marketplaces to other fans who desire access to the creatorâ€™s community. A creatorâ€™s membership token can appreciate in price as the size of their audience grows. This added possibility of investment gives a tangible incentive for fans to financially support their favorite creators. We hope this will lower the barrier for fans to financially support their favorite creators.

Each supporter can own a membership token of different creators. Think of social media, but the follow button is replaced with owning a membership token. Therefore, each individual can access fresh content from their favorite creators in one integrated dashboard.

Our project is still at a very early stage. In the future, we wish to add more features to make our platform more comprehensive. E.g: comment functionality for fans to comment on the creatorâ€™s posts, and messaging functionality for creators to interact with their supporters.
